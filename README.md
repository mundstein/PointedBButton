Usage
-----

Assuming you have already imported BButton, start by importing <code>PointedBButton.m</code> and <code>BButton.h</code> to your Xcode project.

### Use it with Interface Builder : ###

1. Create an UIButton in Interface Builder and change the class to PointedBButton.

2. You can set the target and selector with Interface Builder just like you do with an UIButton.


### Use it without Interface Builder : ###

1. Import the PointedBButton class header :

		#import "PointedBButton.h"
		
2. Create the PointedBButton and add it to a visible view :

		PointedBButton *btn = [[PointedBButton alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(32.0, 20.0, 112.0, 40.0)];
        [btn setTitle:@"Login" forState:UIControlStateNormal]; // Set the button title
        [btn addTarget:self action:@selector(buttonClicked:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
        btn.color = [UIColor purpleColor]; // Set purple color
        [btn setDirection:PointedButtonDirectionLeft];
        [self.view addSubview:btn];
        [btn release];
